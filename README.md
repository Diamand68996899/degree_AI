workable for large and small 
1. implement the Hint (checking for target as new kid_node is generated)
2. implement two Sets to track people explored and nodes in frontier 
3. implement searching efficiency by moving to the first node in the frontier the kid nodes with shorter distance to the target
4. reverse search direction to minimize frontier size.
